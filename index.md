## Biography
---
I am a PhD candidate of [PRISDL](https://ucassdl.cn/) in the School of Electronic, Electrical and Communication Engineering, [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ucas.ac.cn/), advised by Prof. [Qixiang Ye](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0007279?language=en). I got a B.E. degree in Electronic Information School at Wuhan University, Wuhan in June 2018. During my master period，I studied in UCAS and was advised by Prof. Jianbin Jiao and Prof. Qixiang Ye.

My research interests include computer vision and machine learning, specifically for few-shot learning and semantic segmentation.
